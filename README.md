## Introduction
Welcome to the **Secure P2P File Sharing Application**! This project facilitates decentralized and secure file sharing between users, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and privacy. Built with a modern tech stack, it leverages React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and incorporates Celery and Redis for asynchronous task management.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** Enables direct file sharing between peers without a central server.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Protects data during transmission using robust encryption methods.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user verification with JWT and OAuth2 Authentication.
- **Profile Management:** Users can manage their profiles and settings.
- **Real-time File Transfer:** Efficient file sharing with progress tracking and notifications.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Manage permissions for shared files.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React and ChakraUI for a seamless user experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, ChakraUI, Redux, Axios
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL, Postman
- **Database and ORM:** PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- **Others:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, GitHub Actions

## Architecture
```
[Frontend (React + ChakraUI)] <--> [FastAPI Backend] <--> [PostgreSQL Database]
                                       |
                                       --> [Celery Workers] <--> [Redis]
```

- **Frontend:** Handles user interactions and communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- **Backend:** Manages business logic, authentication, and API endpoints.
- **Celery & Redis:** Handle asynchronous tasks such as file processing and sending notifications.
- **Database:** Stores user data, file metadata, and other persistent information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 14+ & npm**
- **PostgreSQL 13+**
- **Redis 6+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

#### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eugeneanokye99/directdrop.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

#### Frontend Setup (React with ChakraUI and TailwindCSS)

1. **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure ChakraUI:**
    Follow [ChakraUI's documentation](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) to set up and customize your UI components.

#### Asynchronous Tasks (Celery & Redis)

1. **Ensure Redis is Running:**
    ```bash
    # Using Docker
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
    ```

2. **Start Celery Worker:**
    ```bash
    celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info
    ```

#### Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

1. **Install PostgreSQL:**
    Follow the official [PostgreSQL installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your OS.

2. **Create Database and User:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;
    CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_db_name TO your_db_user;
    ```

3. **Update Database Configuration:**
    Ensure your backend's environment variables point to the correct database URL.

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary variables. You can use `.env.example` as a template.

*Example `.env`:*

```env
# Backend
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_db_user:your_password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Frontend
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
