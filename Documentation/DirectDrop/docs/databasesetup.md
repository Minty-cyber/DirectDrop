### Explanation

1. **Imports**:

```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from app.core.config import settings
import os

```

- **`create_engine`**: Creates a new SQLAlchemy engine instance that is responsible for connecting to the database.
- **`declarative_base`**: Provides a base class for your ORM models.
- **`sessionmaker`**: A factory that creates new session objects to interact with the database.
- **`os`**: Used to manipulate file paths for database URL configuration.


2. **Getting the Base Directory (`BASE_DIR`)**:

```
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

```

- This line checks the base directory of the project. `os.path.dirname()` moves up one directory from the current file's location.
- The `BASE_DIR` will be used to ensure the SQLite database file is created in the correct location relative to the project structure.
3. **Database URL Configuration (`SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`)**:

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = f"sqlite:///{os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'DirectDrop.db')}"

```

- **`sqlite:///{os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'DirectDrop.db')}`**: This constructs the SQLite database URL. It's an absolute path pointing to the `DirectDrop.db` file located in the `BASE_DIR` directory.
- SQLAlchemy uses this URL to connect to the SQLite database.


4. **Creating the SQLAlchemy Engine**:

```
engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})

```

- **`create_engine()`**: This function creates a new SQLAlchemy engine instance. The engine is responsible for managing the database connection.
- **`connect_args={"check_same_thread": False}`**: This argument is specific to SQLite, which has a threading limitation (it doesn't allow connections to be used in different threads by default). Setting `check_same_thread` to `False` allows the connection to be shared across threads, which is necessary when using SQLite with FastAPI in async mode.


5. **Session Factory (`SessionLocal`)**:

```
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

```

- **`sessionmaker()`**: This is a factory that generates new `Session` objects. These `Session` objects are used to interact with the database.
- **`autocommit=False`**: Disables automatic transaction commits. You must explicitly call `commit()` when you're ready to save changes to the database.
- **`autoflush=False`**: Prevents automatic flushing of changes to the database. SQLAlchemy will only flush data to the database when explicitly told to, such as during a commit or when you query the database.
- **`bind=engine`**: Binds the session factory to the `engine`, ensuring that all sessions created by this factory will use the same database connection.


6. **Base Class for Models (`Base`)**:

```
Base = declarative_base()

```

- **`declarative_base()`**: This function returns a base class that your ORM models will inherit from. All models (tables) defined in your application will be subclasses of this `Base` class. It acts as the foundation for model declarations, linking the Python classes to database tables.


7. **Dependency for Database Session (`get_db`)**:

```
def get_db():
db = SessionLocal()
try:
    yield db
finally:
    db.close()

```

- **`get_db()`**: This is a dependency function that provides a database session for use in your FastAPI route handlers.
    - **`SessionLocal()`**: Creates a new session object for interacting with the database.
    - **`yield db`**: This makes the session available within the context of the function where itâ€™s used (i.e., within a request).
    - **`finally: db.close()`**: Ensures that the session is closed when the request is finished. This prevents database connections from being left open.
