# Diving into the `main.py` in FastAPI Backend

1. **`FastAPI`:**
    - A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
2. **`user_auth`:**
    - This module is assumed to contain authentication-related routes. `user_auth.router` adds a collection of routes (such as login, register, etc.) that handle user authentication.
3. **`engine`:**
    - This refers to a database engine, set up using SQLAlchemy or another ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). It connects your app to a database.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **`from fastapi import FastAPI`:**
    - Imports the FastAPI class from the FastAPI framework, which is used to create the app.
2. **`from app.auth import user_auth`:**
    - Imports `user_auth`, a module that likely contains authentication logic. The `.router` within this module will have a series of routes related to user authentication.
3. **`from app.database.db import engine`:**
    - Imports the `engine` object from the `db` module inside the `database` directory. The engine connects to the database and allows the application to execute queries.
4. **`app = FastAPI()`:**
    - Initializes the FastAPI app instance. This is the main application object that defines your API's behavior.
5. **`app.include_router(user_auth.router)`:**
    - This includes the routes defined in `user_auth.router` (presumably, authentication routes such as login, register, etc.) in the main FastAPI app. The routes will be accessible under the `app`.
6. **`@app.get('/')`:**
    - This is a route decorator that defines a GET endpoint at the root URL (`/`). When users visit the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`), this route will return a welcome message.
7. **`def root():`:**
    - This is the function that handles requests to the root URL. It returns a JSON object with a message about the app's upcoming release.
